//! Client for account registration and cryptography initialization related API methods.
//! It is used both for the initial registration request in the case of password registrations,
//! and for cryptography initialization for a jit provisioned user. After a method
//! on this client is called, the user account should have initialized account keys, an
//! authentication method such as SSO or master password, and a decryption method such as
//! key-connector, TDE, or master password.
